# Motia Crews

Motia Crews is a code-generation toolkit that makes building multi-agent workflows in Motia effortless. Instead of wiring events, state, and step files by hand, you simply define a master agent, add sub-agents with brief descriptions and prompts, click Generate, and instantly download a ready-to-run Motia project. Motia Crews removes the boilerplate so developers can focus on agent logic, rapid experimentation, and autonomous workflows — perfect for hackathons, prototypes, and production-ready agent architectures.
